# Steps to run a basic pipeline 

## Here we will be running the pipeline line in jenkins slave using jenkins master
- Get into you jenkins dashboard
- Select ``` New Item ```
- select ```pipeline```
- you can give description you like
- Pipeline
- Defintion has two drop downs
- Select Pipeline script
  - Pipeline Script: which is where we have to create our custom script
  - Pipeline script from scm[source code management]: we use this option when we
                                                      already have a jenkins file.
  - In the script column you have a drop down we select hello world and we do little bit of modification as we are copying our proj from git repo[ttrends]
  ```
pipeline {
    agent{
        node{
            label: 'maven-agent'
        }
    }

    stages {
        stage('Clone) {
            steps {
                 'git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/DandySabrrish1999/ttrend.git'
            }
        }
    }
}
  ```
- There will be a option ```Pipeline syntax ```
- When you go there you have different modules where you generate the script
