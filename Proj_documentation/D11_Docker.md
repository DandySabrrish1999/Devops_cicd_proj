## 1. Docker
Docker is a tool that allows you to package and run applications in a lightweight, isolated environment called a container. Think of a container like a box that holds everything an application needs to run, including the code, libraries, and system tools. This makes it easier to run the application anywhere—on your computer, on a server, or in the cloud—without worrying about compatibility or setup issues.

Here’s a simple Example:
Imagine you want to move your furniture from one house to another. If you just try to move everything one piece at a time, things might get lost or damaged, and it might not fit properly in the new house. But if you pack everything neatly into boxes, you can move it easily, and everything stays organized.

Similarly, Docker packages an application and its dependencies into a container, so it runs smoothly no matter where it's deployed, without worrying about the underlying system.
