# Configuring Sonarqube Propeties file

1. ```SonarQube properties file```: is like a settings file that tells SonarQube
how to analyze your code. Itâ€™s a text file where you define the specific details that SonarQube needs to run a code
quality scan on your project.
2. You have to named the file as ```sonar-project.properties```

```
sonar.verbose= true                       ## Which give the detailed output
sonar.projectKey=devops_project_udemey    ## Depends on the project
sonar.organization=dev-team               ## Depends on the Org your building the proj on sonarserver
sonar.projectName=devops_udemyproj        ## Name you give to your project on sonarserver
sonar.language=java                       ## Base code
sonar.sourceEncoding=UTF-8                ## Code encrytpion
sonar.sources=.                           ## This is like taking the dependencies from the current
                                          ## location
sonar.java.binaries=target/classes        ## giving the path location of the binaries
sonar.coverage.jacoco.xm1ReportPaths=target/site/jacoco/jacoco.xm1 ## This path is where you want to                                                                        ## store the reports

```
