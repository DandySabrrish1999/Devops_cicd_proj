### Adding the Docker stage in Jenkins file 

- Install ```Docker pipeline plugin``` in Jenkins
- Add the stage code over here from jenkins file
```
def registry = 'https://devopsudemy.jfrog.io'                          
def imageName = 'devopsudemy.jfrog.io/testdocker-docker-local/ttrend'  
stage(" Docker Build ") {
            steps {
        script {
           echo '<--------------- Docker Build Started --------------->'
           app = docker.build(imageName+":"+version)
           echo '<--------------- Docker Build Ends --------------->'
        }
      }
    }

            stage (" Docker Publish "){
        steps {
            script {
               echo '<--------------- Docker Publish Started --------------->'  
                docker.withRegistry(registry, 'Jfrog_Jenkins_Token'){
                    app.push()
                }    
               echo '<--------------- Docker Publish Ended --------------->'  
            }
        }
    }
```
-Variables to change
 - ```def registry```: Replace it with your Jfrog URL
 - ```def imageName```: 'devopsudemy.jfrog.io/testdocker-docker-local/ttrend'  :: 'Jfrog URL/docker URL/name'
      - ```dockerURL```: Application --> Artifactory --> Artifcats --> On the panel you find your docker artifact you created ```dockerartifactname-docker-local::(testdocker-docker-local)```
- Add the docker commands as well to the see containers and all those
- and metnion the errors while running the pipline and why did it cause because of sonar and link worng pasted and link of the repo from jfrog
- and mention abt change the token name too
- wirte the docker command to run the run cotainer nad creation of it and all those
- adn check it in the webpage if its deployed properly or not
