### Adding the Docker stage in Jenkins file 

- Install ```Docker pipeline plugin``` in Jenkins
- Add the stage code over here from jenkins file
```
def registry = 'https://devopsudemy.jfrog.io'                          
def imageName = 'devopsudemy.jfrog.io/testdocker-docker-local/ttrend'  
stage(" Docker Build ") {
            steps {
        script {
           echo '<--------------- Docker Build Started --------------->'
           app = docker.build(imageName+":"+version)
           echo '<--------------- Docker Build Ends --------------->'
        }
      }
    }

            stage (" Docker Publish "){
        steps {
            script {
               echo '<--------------- Docker Publish Started --------------->'  
                docker.withRegistry(registry, 'Jfrog_Jenkins_Token'){
                    app.push()
                }    
               echo '<--------------- Docker Publish Ended --------------->'  
            }
        }
    }
```
### Variables to change from the above code
 - ```def registry```: Replace it with your Jfrog URL
 - ```def imageName```: 'devopsudemy.jfrog.io/testdocker-docker-local/ttrend'  :: 'Jfrog URL/docker URL/name'
      - ```dockerURL```: Application --> Artifactory --> Artifcats --> On the panel you find your docker artifact you created ```dockerartifactname-docker-local::(testdocker-docker-local)``` --> Copy the ```Repository Path```
 - ```docker.withRegistry(registry, 'Jfrog_Jenkins_Token')```: Replace the ```Jfrog_Jenkins_Token``` with the token you have created initially while creating Jfrog account setup (Ref: D10_Jfrogartifactory.md)

- After that you have to push the code to github and then it triggers the pipeline.If you face a error realted to Sonarqube(Refer: E1 below)



### Docker Commands
- Before you execute the pipeline go to your salve system and check these commmands
```
service docker status      ## This is to check if the docker service's is up or not
docker images              ## To check the docker images
dokcer ps -a               ## To check the containers
docker run -d --name demo-udemy -p 8080:8000 devopsudemy.jfrog.io/testdocker-docker-local/ttrend:2.1.2  ## This runs the contianer in background using ttrend:2.1.2 image from Jfrog Registry and it will map port 8000 inside the container to port 8080 on your Jenkins_slave machine by putting Jenkins_slave public i/p:8080 and container named demo-udemy
docker start <container_name or Id>    ## To start the container 
```
- and metnion the errors while running the pipline and why did it cause because of sonar and link worng pasted and link of the repo from jfrog
- and mention abt change the token name too
- wirte the docker command to run the run cotainer nad creation of it and all those
- adn check it in the webpage if its deployed properly or not




### (E1) Errors faced while executing the pipeline 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94b7e2e0-8dcf-4e7f-a868-325b053da5b7)

- When i pushed the code into the Github the pipeline was not executed as because it failed the quality gate in sonaralysis.The above is sonaranalysis error i have face i just marked it safe its a error caused due to permission and prior to that i have meessed up with my Jfrog URL not sure which one casued the error but just incase make sure you put the URL right.
