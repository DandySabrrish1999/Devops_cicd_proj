# Integrating Git_hub with Jenkins

## Cloning the repo to our local system
1. Make sure github & gitbash is installed in your local system
2. Copy the code url and open gitbash within your folder you want to clone the code
   
```
https://github.com/DandySabrrish1999/ttrend.git    ## My url
git clone https://github.com/DandySabrrish1999/ttrend.git
```
3.Now the cloning of the project is done,we execute the following in gitbash
-  We crete a jenkins file      #Make sure you save the file as Jenkinsfile
```
-  git add .
-  git status
-  git commit -m " This is a comment section "
-  git push origin main     #main is the branch the code is working on
```
-  If there is a error pushing the code will configure it,we create a token
     - Go to github profile
     - settings
     - Developer settings
     - Personal access token
     - Tokens (classic)
     - Generate token
     - Generate token (classic)
     - Select the necessary permissions and copy the token and save it
     - Paste the token in gitbash and enter the required prompt details
- Go to jenkins where we have run the pipeline
     - Under the pipeline section in definiton
     - select pipeline script from scm and give the required information below
     - branh: ```*/main```
   

## Adding Github credentials into Jenkins

- Go to jenkins dashboard
- Manage jenkins
- Credentials
- Under credentials tab --> System
- Global credentials (unrestricted)
- Click on add credentials
- kind: ```Username with password```
- Scope:```global```
- Username:``` Git_hub_username```
- Password:``` paste the token generated```
    - Go to github profile
     - settings
     - Developer settings
     - Personal access token
     - Tokens (classic)
     - Generate token
     - Generate token (classic)
     - Select the all the permissions and copy the token and save it
     - Paste the token in gitbash and enter the required prompt details
- ID: ```Github_credentials```     # You can name it however you want just to make the differentiation when you use it
- Click on create,now you have setup the github credentials in jenkins
- Now run the pipeline by clicking on ```Build now```
- Refer to the console syntax in the pipeline where you can find it used the credentials to extract the source code from the repo

## Working with Multi-Branch Pipelines 
- Now we create two branches one manually and other through bash and pull and push so that the changes are reflected to the branches we created
- Create manually from ```github``` itself i have created a branch ``` dev ```
- Now we check if its reflecting in our local or not
```
git add .
git status
git pull origin dev          # dev is the child branch 
git branch                   # It's to verify how many branches are there

```
- Now we create a branch in our gitrepo using ```gitbash```
- Branchname: ```test```
```
git checkout -b test         # test is the other child branch
rm -rf Jenkinsfile           # Deleting the file
git status
git commit -m "Deleting the file"
git push origin test
```
```
vi Jenkinsfile               # Creating the file
cat Jenkinsfile              # Checking the content in the file,copy the content of                               # Jenkinsfile from 
git add .
git status
git commit -m "Creating the file"
git push origin test
```
- To make sure if the opretions done are reflecting or not just go to the repo and refresh the branch and see if the changes are reflected are not.
