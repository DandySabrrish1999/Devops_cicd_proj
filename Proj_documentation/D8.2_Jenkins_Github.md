## Cloning the repo to our local system
1. Make sure github & gitbash is installed in your local system
2. Copy the code url and open gitbash within your folder you want to clone the code
   
```
https://github.com/DandySabrrish1999/ttrend.git    ## My url
git clone https://github.com/DandySabrrish1999/ttrend.git
```
3.Now the cloning of the project is done,we execute the following in gitbash
-  We crete a jenkins file      #Make sure you save the file as Jenkinsfile
```
-  git add .
-  git status
-  git commit -m " This is a comment section "
-  git push origin main     #main is the branch the code is working on
```
-  If there is a error pushing the code will configure it,we create a token
     - Go to github profile
     - settings
     - Developer settings
     - Personal access token
     - Tokens (classic)
     - Generate token
     - Generate token (classic)
