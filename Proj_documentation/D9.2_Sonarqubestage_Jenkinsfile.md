# Configuring the Jenkins file by adding a Sonarqube stage
1. Documentation: ```https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/9.9/analyzing-source-code/scanners/jenkins-extension-sonarqube/```
2. Here we make changes to the previous jenkins that we are using in this project. So,we take the stage code block from the above documentation under ```Sonarscanner```
   ```
   stage('SonarQube analysis') {
            environment {
            scannerHome = tool 'SonarScanner_devopsudemy'            // This you can find in jenkins dashboard from global tool configuration refer to doc D9_Sonarqube_setup.md 
            }
            steps {
            withSonarQubeEnv('SonarQube_Server_devopsudemy') {        // This you can find in jenkins dashboard from configure system refer to doc D9_Sonarqube_setup.md
                                                                       // If you have configured more than one global server connection, you can specify its name
            sh "${scannerHome}/bin/sonar-scanner"
        }
    }
   ```
   3. I have made changes accordingly to the requirements
   4. Now we have to push the code the main branch and check the jenkins dashboard where the pipeline runs
